## 📂 Project Structure

- **debugging/factorial.py**: Iterative implementation of factorial calculation.
- **debugging/factorial_recursive.py**: Recursive implementation of factorial calculation.
- **debugging/print_arguments.py**: Prints command-line arguments passed to the script.
- **debugging/change_background.html**: A simple HTML page to change the background color dynamically.
- **debugging/mines.py**: A basic Minesweeper game implementation.
- **debugging/checkbook.py**: A virtual checkbook application to manage deposits and withdrawals.
- **debugging/tic_tac_toe.py**: A classic Tic Tac Toe game for two players.
